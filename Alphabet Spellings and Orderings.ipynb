    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "I was watching a tiktok the other day that mentioned this: the letters of the English alphabet have spellings, and those spellings are not in alphabetical order. The creator then went on to \"alphabetize\" the alphabet by alphabetizing the spellings and then turning them back into their respective letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, I noticed an issue: the spellings of the English letters were still not in alphabetical order if we consider the new alphabet he had created! This lead me to ask, was it possible to reorder the alphabet into a new one where the spellings are in alphabetical order according to this new alphabet?\n",

    "## The Spellings\n",
    "\n",
    "First. we have to know the spellings to know how to order them."

    "There is a way to do find such an alphabet. Note that we went from a list of letters to a list of spellings, ordered that list of spellings, then went back to a list of letters. When we did this, the first list of letters and the second list of letters was the same. However, if the list of spellings was actually in order, then when we try to sort the list of spellings it won't change, and as a result when we turn it back into a list of letters, we get the same list of letters as before. Therefore, if we just keep repeating the process of turning these letters into spellings, sorting the spelling, and turning them back into letters until we get the same list of letters twice, then we've found the alphabet we wanted. However, to do this we need to be able to sort these spellings according to any alphabet. To do this, let's make a mergesort function that works for any comparison function. (We can use any comparison-based sorting here, but I chose mergesort)."
